# Bi-Copter
A coaxial bi-copter, pioneering a new technology for thrust vector control with a custom ESP 32 flight computer. Inspired from NASA's Ingenuity, the aircraft achieves flight by generating aerodynamic lift from two main points. Each point consists of a pair of propellers arranged coaxially (one above the other on the same axis).
